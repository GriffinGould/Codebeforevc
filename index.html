<p>Greetings, I am Griffin Gould. I am 18 and I am a student at WSU. I enjoy sail boats. The USS Constitution is my favorite because it is the oldest commisioned war ship that is still capable of sailing. The HMS Victory is a close second. The Victory is significant because it was admiral Horation Nelson's flag ship at the battle of Trafalgar. The Victory is a first rate ship of the line whereas the Constitution is a heavy frigate. The Constitution, while not the largest war ship, represented a paragon shift in ship building philosophy. The Constitution's timbers were significantly thicker around the who than most ships of its size. This means that it was capable of engaging much larger ships while still taking advantage of its superior manuverability.</p>
<p>The HMS Victory was a standard first rate ship of the line. It was big but wasn't the biggest ship in the fleet. The Victory is unique because of the role that it played at the battle of Trafalgar. At the battle of Trafalgar, the British fleet under the command of Admiral Nelson defeated a numeriacally superior combined Spanish and French fleet. Admiral Nelson defied naval orthodoxy by choosing to array his forces in two columns and attacking the Franco-Spanish fleet in a pronged attack to the flank. This maneuver would later be come to be known as crossing the T. During the battle, Lord Nelson was struck in the shoulder by a stray musket ball fired from the spars of an enemy warship. Admiral Nelson died of the injury soon after and his body was placed in a coffin filled with brandy to preserve it.</p>
